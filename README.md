# holbertonschool-printf

## DESCRIPTION
**Holberton School's "printf" project is a C programming exercise to create a custom function that mimics the behavior of the printf() function in the standard C library.**

**The printf() function is commonly used to display formatted strings in standard output, such as the console or a file. The goal of this project is to understand how the printf() function works by creating a custom version of this function that provides the same functionality and formatting options.**

**The "printf" project consists of creating a function named "ft_printf" that takes as input a formatted string (like the one used with printf()) and produces the same output as printf(). The "ft_printf" function must be able to handle type conversions, such as integers, floats and strings, as well as formatting options, such as width and precision specifiers.**

## SPECIFICATEURS
***Between % is the format specifier you can place, in order :

***Flags (in any order), which modify the specification:
These flags can be used in any order and can modify the format specifier in various ways. Some common flags include:

***1. "-" : left-align the output within the specified width.
***2. "+" : always prefix the output with a sign (+ or -).
***3. " " : prefix the output with a space character if it is positive.
***4. "0" : pad the output with leading zeros instead of spaces.
***5. "#" : add an alternate form of output for certain format specifiers (e.g. add "0x" prefix for hexadecimal output).
***6. "*" : the width or precision of the output is specified by an integer argument passed as an additional argument to the function.
