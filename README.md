# holbertonschool-printf

## DESCRIPTION
**Holberton School's "printf" project is a C programming exercise to create a custom function that mimics the behavior of the printf() function in the standard C library.**

**The printf() function is commonly used to display formatted strings in standard output, such as the console or a file. The goal of this project is to understand how the printf() function works by creating a custom version of this function that provides the same functionality and formatting options.**

**The "printf" project consists of creating a function named "ft_printf" that takes as input a formatted string (like the one used with printf()) and produces the same output as printf(). The "ft_printf" function must be able to handle type conversions, such as integers, floats and strings, as well as formatting options, such as width and precision specifiers.**
