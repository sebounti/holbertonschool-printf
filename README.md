# holbertonschool-printf

## DESCRIPTION
**Holberton School's "printf" project is a C programming exercise to create a custom function that mimics the behavior of the printf() function in the standard C library.**

**The printf() function is commonly used to display formatted strings in standard output, such as the console or a file. The goal of this project is to understand how the printf() function works by creating a custom version of this function that provides the same functionality and formatting options.**

**The "printf" project consists of creating a function named "ft_printf" that takes as input a formatted string (like the one used with printf()) and produces the same output as printf(). The "ft_printf" function must be able to handle type conversions, such as integers, floats and strings, as well as formatting options, such as width and precision specifiers.**

## SPECIFICATEURS
Between % is the format specifier you can place, in order :

Flags (in any order), which modify the specification:
> - frames the converted argument to the left;
> + systematically prints the sign of the number;
> space if the first character is not a sign, places a space at the beginning.
> 0 for numerical conversions, completes the beginning of the field with 0s,
> # specifies a different output format:
> for o, the first digit will be 0,
> for x or X, 0x or 0X will be added if the result is not null,
> for e,E,f,g,and G, the output will always contain a decimal point,
> for g and G, the terminating 0's will be kept.
  
A number which specifies the minimum width of the print field (completed if necessary by spaces or 0 if requested by the corresponding flag).
